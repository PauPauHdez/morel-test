- [authors]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/author)
- [city of publication]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/city)
- [imprint or publisher]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/publisher)
- [nationality of authors]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/nationality)
- [edition date]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/edition)
- [digital repository]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/repository).
